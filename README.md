These scripts are provided to help the proper set-up of a debian based system
to allow compilation of the sources for:
libindi, 
indi-3rd-party, 
stellarsolver, 
libXIFS, 
and kstars

Best is to install these scripts into your ~/bin directory

My scripts assume French as locale so if you have different locale exit bkstars for the git response 'Déjà à jour"
